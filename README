Snelheid - The simple speedometer

Snelheid uses the HTML5 Geolocation API to calculate your speed using your devices location hardware.
For the security conscious of you out there this app has no communication with the server; in fact it stores everything it needs offline.

Snelheid goes wherever you (and your device) travel.

-------------------------------------------------------------

To use Snelheid just visit willemh.webege.com/snelheid and it will start working.

If you tap on the number displaying the speed the theme will toggle between black on white and vice-versa.
If you tap on the unit (km/h) the text will create a mirror image allowing you to place your device on your car's dashboard, giving you an instant HUD (Heads Up Display).

Pretty cool huh?
